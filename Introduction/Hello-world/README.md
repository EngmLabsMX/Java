### How can run this examples

- To run this examples in your own PC you need install JDK in your system, you can review the oracle web site to found [How install JDK in your PC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A "Oracle Web Site")

- Once installed, We will proceed to open PowerShell or any console software within of our PC and will run the below commands

### Commands

`$ java -version`

`$ javac -version`

- after of check if all java components was installed succesfull you can proceed to run the exaples in your pc

- you need to compile the .java file withe javac command
1. Download the [Hello.java file ](https://github.com/EngmLabsMX/Java/blob/main/Introduction/Hello-world/Hello.java) and compile it in your PC with the below command

`$ javac Hello.java`

and  after of compile it, javac command will create a file named Hello.class, this files will be the file that can execute in our command line, you can run it with the below command

`$ java Hello`

The `javac` command is used to compile Java source code files (files with a `.java` extension) into bytecode files (files with a `.class` extension) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Here's why you need to use the `javac` command after writing a Java program:

1.  Compilation: Java is a compiled language, which means that your source code must be translated into bytecode before it can be executed. When you write Java code in a `.java` file, it's in human-readable form. The `javac` command takes this source code and generates a bytecode representation of your program.
    
2.  Error Checking: The `javac` compiler performs syntax and type checking on your code. It checks for any errors in your code, such as syntax errors, undeclared variables, or type mismatches. This helps catch and fix issues in your code before you attempt to run it, reducing the chances of runtime errors.
    
3.  Portability: Bytecode generated by `javac` is platform-independent, which means you can compile your Java code on one platform (e.g., Windows) and then execute it on another platform (e.g., Linux or macOS) without modification. This is a key feature of the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy of Java.
    
4.  Optimization: The `javac` compiler can also perform certain optimizations on your code to improve its performance. These optimizations can make your Java program run faster and use resources more efficiently.
    

Once you've successfully compiled your Java code using `javac`, you can use the `java` command to run the compiled bytecode. The `java` command loads the bytecode into the JVM and executes it.

In summary, the `javac` command is an essential step in the Java development process as it translates your human-readable source code into bytecode that can be executed by the JVM, performs error checking, ensures platform independence, and may apply optimizations to your code.
